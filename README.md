## Suggestions for Object Orientated Design
Whenever writing code in an object orientated language, sticking to the following list of suggestions will make your code amenable to changes with the least effort.
* <b>Separate</b> out parts of code that vary or change from those that remain the same.
* Always code to <b>an interface</b> and not against a concrete implementation.
* <b>Encapsulate</b> behaviors as much as possible.
* Favor composition over inheritance. Inheritance can result in explosion of classes and also sometimes the base class is fitted with new functionality that isn't applicable to some of its derived classes.
* Interacting components within a system <b>should be as loosely coupled as possible.</b>
* Ideally, class design should <b>inhibit modification and encourage extension.</b>
* Using patterns in your day to day work, allows exchanging entire implementation concepts with other developers via shared pattern vocabulary.

## Why Patterns ?
The answer is we <b>don't want to reinvent the wheel!</b> Problems that occur frequently enough in tech life usually have <b>well-defined solutions, which are flexible, modular and more understandable.</b> These solutions when abstracted away from the tactical details become design patterns.
